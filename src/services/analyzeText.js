/**
 * Analyze raw ingredients text end to end.
 *
 * Returns { report, isIngredientOnly, knownCount, researchedCount }.
 *
 * isIngredientOnly is true when the text parsed down to a single
 * ingredient (e.g. someone searching "INS 102" or "Tartrazine" directly)
 * rather than a real multi-ingredient product — callers should treat this
 * as an ingredient lookup, not a product scan, and skip saving it to the
 * shared product cache (the ingredient itself is already cached in the
 * ingredients table, so caching it again as a "product" is redundant).
 *
 * nutrientsInfo (optional) -- real, already-known nutrition-panel
 * numbers for this exact product ({ nutrients, servingLabel }, see
 * openFoodFacts.js / blinkitProductsRepo.js), used only to power the
 * "if this became a daily habit" projection. Never estimated -- when a
 * caller has no real numbers for a product (e.g. pasted/photographed
 * text with no nutrition panel), it's simply omitted and that section
 * doesn't appear.
 *
 * packSize (optional) -- the human-readable pack size as printed on
 * the pack ("500 g", "2 x 2 kg"), when the caller happens to know it
 * (currently only Blinkit's scraper, see blinkit.js). Purely
 * descriptive -- stored on the report so it's visible when someone's
 * trying to find/verify this exact product's real barcode later,
 * since different pack sizes of the same product have different
 * barcodes.
