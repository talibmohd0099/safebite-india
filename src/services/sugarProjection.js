// Deliberately NOT a prediction of what happens to anyone's body: one
// product's label can't know the rest of someone's diet, activity or
// health, so any "this causes X" framing would be inventing certainty
// the data doesn't have (and is exactly the unsubstantiated-harm-claim
// pattern a food brand sued another label app over). What IS knowable
// is plain quantity -- and research on sugar labelling found exactly
// that works best: teaspoons of sugar rated most effective and read as
// "factual and objective", where a vague "high in sugar" did not.
//
// The SUGAR figure is always the label's own, never estimated. The
// SERVING it's multiplied by comes from servingResolver.js, which says
// where it came from -- the label, the pack itself, or a typical
// serving for the category (an estimate the UI labels as such).
// No AI call, no network -- null whenever there's no honest story.
